## Introduction

This presentation has been made by a group of UBC students in the MDS program. More information about the MDS program can be found at <https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/>.

## Course Specifics

The course that this presentation has been made for is **DSCI 521** which has been a great learning experience, especially for those coming for a non-programming background because it lays down the most important fundamentals required for a career in Data Science - namely the use of GitHub for collaboration on projects.

## Code Example 1

Below we are creating a variable called 'temp' and then storing in it the sum of 1 and 1 and then printing the output:


```{r, echo=TRUE}
temp <- 1+1
temp
```

## Code Example 2
Below we are creating a list with the elements 1, 2 and 3, and then printing it out:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
list1 <- c(1, 2, 3)
list1
```
